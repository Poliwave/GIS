## Disclaimer from Elections Manitoba

Maps are provided for informational purposes only. Note the following:

* The voting area boundaries and associated maps relate only to the 43rd general election of October 3, 2023. Data for these maps is current as of election day. All information was believed to be accurate at the time, but is not guaranteed to be without error.
* Voting area boundaries and associated maps are prepared for internal operational purposes by Elections Manitoba.
* Voting area boundaries for subsequent and previous elections will differ from those displayed here. As such, these voting area maps cannot be used for comparative purposes with other elections.
* Electoral division boundaries are reviewed every 10 years under Manitobaâ€™s Electoral Divisions Act. The current boundaries were set in 2018 by the Electoral Divisions Boundaries Commission.
* Not all voting areas relate to a geographical location on the map. Votes cast using the following voting methods are not related to a location on the map: advance, homebound, absentee, personal security and institutional. For that reason, map-based results will not tally with the total number of votes cast within an electoral division.
